# Golf Analytics

## Abstract
This project aims to utilize golf swing data (particularly from down swing and impact) from Trackman to explore the importance of features in the downswing on final carry and finding the optimal range of values for those features. Considering the anatomy of a golf swing, slight differences at various points in the of a golf swing can affect the ball flight to different degrees. Importantly, a golfer’s club face and swing speed on the down swing have significant effects on the shot’s direction and distance, respectively.  

In this project, we intend to take a birds-eye view, considering the final product of distance and direction. So far, this project has deduced the order of important for the nine important features considered in this project and done analysis to explore the regression line for each feature and the effect of pairwise combinations for certain features.  

In this semester, we will aim to bring our project to manifest a real-life impact through building a dashboard that compares a user’s imputed data to provide feedback, essentially acting as a free, digital coach. This dashboard will be built on analysis done in the past, as well as new methods including Natural Language Processing to translate numerical data into verbal feedback.  

## Introduction 
To many golfers, analyzing their own swing is a difficult task as the sport strikes between split-second precision and long-term consistency. With the invention of Trackman, it is now easier to visualize shots in set weather conditions and obtain data on features of the swing; however, analysis of such data is a difficult task for most, as the complexity of a golf swing means various distance and directional features are at play together. Understanding the optimal values of those features and how they work together is the ideal way to help golfers who want to optimize their carry distance.  

This project stems from this motivation and utilizes golf swing data from Trackman to analyze the importance of features in the down swing as well as deducing the optimal ranges of value that those features should take on. In the fall semester, Erica worked with nine key features in the down swing, evaluated their regression relationships with carry distance, and examined the impact of pairwise feature interactions on carry.  

In this upcoming semester, we will be exploring a way to utilize our analysis in the real world: an interactive dashboard. We aim to develop a website/application where golfers are able to input data on the aforementioned nine key features and receive feedback on their performance. Numerically, they will see how their data distribution compares to the optimal range and receive data on their most frequent shot location and carry distance. To be more helpful for golfers, we aim to utilize Natural Language Processing to convert numerical insights into verbal feedback that suggests areas of improvement for the user.  

## Methodology 
Having utilized supervised learning methods including random forest regression and support vector regression, we aim to further confirm the validity of our current findings by implementing an XGBoost model to receive another perspective on our data.  

For the interactive dashboard, we will build the app using the MERN tech stack. If we encounter any difficulties with building this from scratch, we may potentially use a framework for the dashboard web app. 

## Data Source 
All data used in this project was obtained from the Trackman simulators at the Elkridge Golf Galaxy location. These shots are a combination of employee, customer, and Erica’s shots. While not representative of all mastery levels, some shots have been made to be “bad” in order to encompass a wider range of possibilities.
