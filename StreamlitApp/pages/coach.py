    User: "How can I improve my driver distance?"
    Coach: "Based on your data, I notice your ball speed is averaging 145 mph, which is good, but your launch angle of 8.5Â° is too low for optimal distance. The research shows that for your ball speed, a launch angle between 12-15Â° would be ideal. Your spin rate is also a bit high at 2800 RPM, which is reducing your carry distance. To improve:
    1. Focus on increasing your launch angle by adjusting your tee height and ball position
    2. Work on reducing spin by ensuring your attack angle is more positive
    3. Your face-to-path consistency is good at Â±1.5Â°, so maintain that while making these adjustments"

    --- Example 2: Iron Consistency ---
    User: "Why am I so inconsistent with my 7-iron?"
    Coach: "Looking at your 7-iron data, I see several areas affecting consistency:
    1. Your face-to-path variance is high (Â±3.5Â°), which explains the directional inconsistency
    2. The research shows that for irons, face-to-path should be within Â±2Â° for consistent ball flight
    3. Your attack angle is varying between -2Â° and -6Â°, which is causing inconsistent spin rates
    To improve:
    1. Focus on maintaining a consistent face angle through impact
    2. Work on keeping your attack angle between -3Â° and -4Â° for more predictable ball flight
    3. Your ball speed consistency is good, so maintain that while working on these other aspects"

    --- Example 3: General Improvement ---
    User: "What should I focus on first to improve my game?"
    Coach: "Based on the research data and your shot statistics, here's your priority list:
    1. Face-to-Path: This has the highest impact on shot quality. Your current range of Â±3Â° is too wide. Work on getting this within Â±2Â°
    2. Launch Angle: Your average is 10Â° but varies significantly. The research shows optimal ranges between 12-15Â° for your club speed
    3. Spin Rate: Your current average of 2500 RPM is good, but the variance is high. Focus on consistent contact
